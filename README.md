## 🌐 Live Demo
Challenge it here: [clicky-owls.vercel.app](https://clicky-owls.vercel.app) — click through all the owls, but don't click the same owl twice!

## Overview
**Deliverable:** A lighthearted memory game built with React.js. Players must click through randomly shuffled owls without repetition, encouraging them to sharpen their focus and strategic recall.

**Purpose:** To provide a memory-strengthening experience that rewards concentration and attention to detail.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React.js
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## ✨ Features
- Memory-based gameplay with instant feedback
- Responsive 4×3 (desktop) / 3x4 (mobile) grid layout
- Confetti animation on win using `react-confetti`
- Smooth animated message transitions with `framer-motion`
- Accessibility-conscious design (`aria-live`, semantic landmarks, screen reader support)
- Freeze UI after win to prevent further clicks until restart
- Restart button with complete state reset

## 📚 What I Learned
- Git on macOS may ignore changes like `ScoreBoard.jsx` → `Scoreboard.jsx`. Use `git mv` to force rename.
- React setState() is asynchronous — Don't rely on the immediate value update within the same function.
- Replaced legacy JavaScript array method `.concat()` with the functional `setState()` pattern.
- Vercel deployment was smooth once path resolution and casing were corrected.
- A focus on a11y and UI feedback made the app more polished and inclusive.
